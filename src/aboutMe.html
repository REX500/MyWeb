            <h1>This is me!</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I was born in the capital of Croatia, Zagreb on 4th of June 1996. as a Son of Darko and Snjezana.
                Growing up I spent quite a lot of time in the forest thanks to two weekend houses that we had.
                There I learned how to ride a bike, motor bike, play in the forest, learned to respect the nature
                and so on. Not long after I started training sports. I always had a dedication towards sports and
                wanted to be the best. Search for the right sport wasn't easy but I found it in running. Started when
                I was 15 and not long after I joined the athletics club Dinamo Zrinjevac where I discovered that I am
                far more capable then I though before. That shaped me for life, put me in the mind state that I am
                now in.
                I went to a Technical school where I was thought how electronics work. We did stuff from soldering
                our own electric circuits to programing in C and assembler.
                Not to be mistaken, running wasnt the only big accomplishment, coming to Denmark and getting settled
                was something that I am still working on but I know that my past shaped me in a person that is able
                to succeed no matter what!

            <h2> Active lifestyle is what defines me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Ever since I can remember I was doing sports. Since I could walk I did tennis, swimming, basketball, football,
            airsoft, climbing, mtb driving, motorcicyling, martial arts, athletics and now gym. I believe that us as human
            we are defined by moving, we simply cannot function without exercise and therefore I urge everyone I meet to
            get of their buts and start doing something!</p>
